# Week 0 – Scratch 🧩

🎓 Part of **CS50x 2024 – Introduction to Computer Science by Harvard University**

## 📘 Overview
This week introduced the fundamentals of programming using Scratch, a visual programming language. It focused on building logic, sequencing, loops, and event-driven programming—all without writing a single line of code.

## 💻 Project
- ✅ Custom Scratch Project ([project.sb3](project.sb3))

## 🚀 Key Takeaways
- Learned how computers can execute instructions through logic blocks.
- Developed an understanding of control flow and events.
- Built confidence in constructing basic algorithms visually.

## 🧠 Challenges
Designing interactive behavior with broadcast messages and handling conditions inside loops was initially tricky, but visual feedback in Scratch helped me understand it faster.
