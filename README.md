# Week 0 – Scratch 

 Part of **CS50x 2024 – Introduction to Computer Science by Harvard University**

##  Overview
This week introduced the fundamentals of programming using Scratch, a visual programming language. It focused on building logic, sequencing, loops, and event-driven programming—all without writing a single line of code.

##  Project
-  Custom Scratch Project ([project.sb3](project.sb3))

##  Key Takeaways
- Learned how computers can execute instructions through logic blocks.
- Developed an understanding of control flow and events.
- Built confidence in constructing basic algorithms visually.

##  Challenges
Designing interactive behavior with broadcast messages and handling conditions inside loops was initially tricky, but visual feedback in Scratch helped me understand it faster.
